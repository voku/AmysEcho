# Amy’s Echo

**This repository contains the development work for my little girl — to help her be understood, to help her learn, and to help others understand her world.**

Amy is four years old. She was born with **22q11 Deletion Syndrome** and communicates using **German Sign Language (DGS)**. Her gestures are expressive, her intent is clear — but most people around her don’t understand what she’s trying to say.

This project aims to fix that.

## 🎯 Purpose

> Don’t build for everyone. Build for one. But do it well enough that everyone could follow.

Amy’s Echo is a gesture recognition system designed to translate DGS into speech and symbols — in real time, offline if needed, and always with clarity and care.

This is not a demo or experiment. It’s a production-grade, full-stack project with one goal:

> **Turn Amy’s gesture into understanding. Every time.**

## 🧠 Architecture: Hybrid-First

Amy’s Echo is designed around a hybrid loop:

1. **See**: Capture gesture via camera.
2. **Think**: Run ML classification (cloud preferred, local fallback).
3. **Speak + Show**: Output voice and symbol.
4. **Confirm**: Gentle haptic + visual confirmation.
5. **Learn**: Corrections are logged, models adapt over time.

Fallbacks are not optional. The system must **always** respond — even when uncertain.

## 🔵 Interaction Flows (HIPs)

| Protocol | Purpose                                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| HIP 1    | Onboarding (consent, first-use setup)    |
| HIP 2    | Teach mode (caregiver trains a new sign) |
| HIP 3    | Correction mode (“Help Me” repair flow)  |
| HIP 4    | Maintenance (“Let’s practice this again”)|

---

## 🗃️ Core Goals

- **Turn gestures into speech and visuals**
- **Work offline-first, no cloud dependency**
- **Handle uncertainty with grace, not silence**
- **Log every correction to learn and adapt**
- **Make it simple for a child to succeed**

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Spec ([markdown](./spec/AmysEcho.md))
- [x] React Native baseline setup
- [x] Camera + ML integration (initial hybrid recognizer)
- [x] HIP 1 + HIP 3 MVP implementation
- [ ] ...

## ▶️ Running the mobile app

The React Native code lives in `app/`. Install dependencies with `npm install` inside that folder, then run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start a simulator. This skeleton includes onboarding, recognition, correction and training screens. Camera and ML integration now have an initial hybrid recognizer stub.
